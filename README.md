# AdvPT Project WS 2024: Handwriting Recognition (MNIST)

This project template contains some files to get your project started.

As described in the project sheet, your task is to develop a fully-connected neural network in C++ for the recognition
of the handwritten digits found in the MNIST dataset.
We test your implementation by running the following shell scripts with our own (and not publicly available) datasets:

* `build.sh`: Shall contain all necessary code to prepare/build your executable(s)
* `read_dataset_images.sh`: Checks if you can successfully read in, convert and write an MNIST dataset image to file.
* `read_dataset_labels.sh`: Checks if you can successfully read in and write an MNIST dataset label to file.
* `mnist.sh`: Triggers the training and testing of your neural network implementation.
